    <h1 style="color: blue;">parent love </h1>
    <p>parents love their kids. I there any love which is true? 
        yes... parents love is true for their kids but 
        sometimes some parents do not love their kids as much as 
        their kid need it is actually parens do not understand 
        some of their kids need some more attention 
        this happened with me like one of my parent do not understand
        that i need some love and attentions but being a parent 
        i always give attention and look closely that my kids need love 
        and how much they need
